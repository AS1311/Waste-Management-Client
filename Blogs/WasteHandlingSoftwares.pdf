firms to take care of the disposal need the software for record keeping, reporting and invoicing. This way, it becomes a lot easier for the business to achieve sustainability targets as well as comply with legal 
standards of waste disposal.Also, companies that deal with waste management and recycling need to use the software for the sake of remaining profitable in the current competitive and dynamic legislative systems.
