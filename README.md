# Waste Management System
There are many dustbins around us and we see they are cleared at certain intervals. But sometimes we find the dustbins to be full and yet not cleared of its contents.
Since we don't have a single platform where we could track and register new complaints, we find it difficult to do anything related to the problem. Thus we the students of VSSUT, Burla are making a platform which will be used as a pilot project in our campus to track the complaints in a very efficent and easy way.
