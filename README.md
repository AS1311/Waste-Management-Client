# Waste Management System
There are many dustbins around us and we see they are cleared at certain intervals. But sometimes we find the dustbins to be full and yet not cleared of its contents.

Since we don't have a single platform where we could track and register new complaints, we find it difficult to do anything related to the problem. Thus we are making a platform which will be used as a pilot project for different campus to track the complaints in a very efficent and easy way. For building the platform we are basically using NodeJs. 

The user interface of the platform is inside the [UI](https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Waste-Management-Client/tree/main/UI) directory. Please follow it strictly for your contribution.
